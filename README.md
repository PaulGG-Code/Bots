# Bots

Bots are software programs that combine requests, which are typically provided as text, with contextual data, such as geolocation and payment information, to appropriately 
handle the request and respond. Bots are often also called "chatbots", "assistants" or "agents."

I always had the curiosity to write my own bots and automate my life. Well you know, sometimes I say, 24hours aren't enough for the day.  😁 😆
